# aws-startups-solution-architecture

Technical AWS solutions for the problems startups actually get stuck on, from the AWS Startups Solution Architecture team.

This plugin is **project scaffolding with three exemplar skills**. It exists so Startup SAs have somewhere to contribute the hard technical patterns they solve repeatedly in the field. If you are an SA with a pattern you have explained more than twice, it belongs here. See [what to contribute](#what-to-contribute).

## Scope

Technical architecture and AWS problem solving. Not founder coaching, not stage-appropriateness advice, not business guidance.

The startup qualifier means the **technical constraints** are startup constraints: no dedicated platform or security team, a fixed cost ceiling that is someone's runway, capacity you cannot commit years to, and a deadline that is a funding milestone. Those constraints change the correct technical answer, and that difference is what this plugin captures.

| This plugin                                                           | Not this plugin                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tenant isolation enforced in IAM for a team with no security engineer | How to write an IAM policy (see `aws-iam` in `aws-core`)               |
| Securing scarce GPU capacity without a multi-year commitment          | Which GPU instance family is fastest (see `aws-compute` in `aws-core`) |
| The technical shape of a problem given startup constraints            | Whether a startup is ready for Series A (see AWS Startup Advisor)      |

Two neighbors own adjacent surface, and staying off theirs is the point:

- **[Agent Toolkit for AWS](https://github.com/aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws)** owns general AWS service depth. Consumed here as an upstream dependency, never restated.
- **[AWS Startup Advisor](../../../advisor/)** owns founder-facing and business-facing guidance: stage, runway, credits, AWS Activate, fundraise readiness.

## Skills

Three exemplars, each chosen because neither neighbor covers it and each is a recurring field problem.

| Skill                    | Problem it solves                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `multi-tenant-isolation` | Tenancy model per layer, isolation enforced in IAM and the database rather than application code, per-tenant cost attribution, and what to do when one enterprise customer demands dedicated infrastructure. |
| `gpu-capacity-strategy`  | Getting accelerated capacity at all, getting quota approved, surviving Spot interruption mid-training, and avoiding a multi-year commitment signed against a projection.                                     |
| `agentcore-patterns`     | Running a judgment agent inside your own CI path: what it may block, measuring verdict stability before it gates anything, confidence banding, and warm-container staleness.                                 |

`agentcore-patterns` is also the layout exemplar: a thin `SKILL.md` router with the depth in `references/`. That is the intended shape for this plugin, since solution-architecture content is mostly reference material.

## What to contribute

Verified gaps: as of this writing, neither Agent Toolkit for AWS nor AWS Startup Advisor covers the following, and each is a recurring startup engagement topic. This is the call for contribution.

- **Self-hosted inference serving.** Continuous batching, paged attention and KV cache behavior, concurrency and batch tuning, choosing a serving stack, and when a self-hosted endpoint genuinely beats a managed one on cost at real utilization. Currently zero coverage of the serving mechanics in either neighbor.
- **Scale-to-zero architectures** where an idle environment must cost approximately nothing, including which managed services have a nonzero floor and what that floor actually is.
- **Service quota and limit strategy** ahead of a launch or traffic event, treating quota as lead-time-bound rather than instantaneous.
- **Compliance groundwork** (SOC 2, HIPAA) implemented by a team with no compliance function, scoped to the technical controls and evidence rather than the audit process.
- **Cost regression detection** in the deploy path, so a per-unit cost increase is caught before the monthly bill.

Bring your own topic if it fits the scope test above. Every contribution must pass all three criteria in the [contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md); criterion 2, no overlap with Agent Toolkit for AWS, rejects most proposals, so check the upstream skill list first.

The existing skills are the intended shape and depth: decision tables, the failure mode named explicitly, an anti-pattern list, and service mechanics delegated upstream rather than restated.

## Upstream dependencies

Declared in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and resolved automatically at install time:

- [`aws-core`](https://github.com/aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws/tree/main/plugins/aws-core): infrastructure-as-code authoring, core services, IAM, observability, cost management.
- [`aws-agents`](https://github.com/aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws/tree/main/plugins/aws-agents): building, deploying, and operating AI agents on AWS.

Both live in the `claude-plugins-official` marketplace, so this repo's `marketplace.json` lists that marketplace in `allowCrossMarketplaceDependenciesOn`. Without that entry, install fails with a `cross-marketplace` error. They are intentionally unversioned: version constraints resolve against `{plugin-name}--v{version}` git tags, and the upstream repo publishes none, so a semver range would fail with `no-matching-tag`. See [plugin dependencies](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-dependencies).

Installing this plugin also installs and enables both dependencies. The skills here defer to them for service specifics rather than duplicating that guidance.

## Install

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add awslabs/startups

# Install the plugin
/plugin install aws-startups-solution-architecture@startups-for-aws
```

Or load locally during development:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./solution-architecture/plugins/aws-startups-solution-architecture
```
