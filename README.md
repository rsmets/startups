| **[aws-startup-advisor](advisor/)**                              | Startup-focused build + migrate guidance built on patterns from 350,000+ startups: AWS Activate credits & offers, a knowledge base (sample architectures, learn articles), a copy-paste prompt library, stage-aware architecture advice, and interactive scaffolding — plus the full migration toolkit (gcp-to-aws, heroku-to-aws, llm-to-bedrock, agent-advisor, tf-best-practices) | Available |
| **[migration-to-aws](migrate/)**                                 | Assess, plan & execute: migrate GCP/Heroku infrastructure and AI workloads to AWS (discovery, architecture mapping, cost analysis, Terraform), rewrite LLM SDK calls to Amazon Bedrock, and select an AWS runtime + build a POC for AI agents. Bundles the gcp-to-aws, heroku-to-aws, llm-to-bedrock, and agent-advisor skills                                                       | Available |
| **[aws-startups-solution-architecture](solution-architecture/)** | Technical AWS solutions for the problems startups get stuck on: multi-tenant SaaS isolation enforced in IAM rather than application code, and accelerated compute capacity strategy for teams that cannot sign multi-year commitments. Draws general-purpose AWS service depth from Agent Toolkit for AWS as an upstream dependency                                                  | Available |

## How the migration-to-aws skills work together

`migration-to-aws` is a single plugin bundling four skills that cover assessment, execution, and agent runtime decisions:

- **gcp-to-aws / heroku-to-aws** — assess and plan a platform migration: scan infrastructure (Terraform, billing, source code), map services to AWS equivalents, estimate costs, and generate validated Terraform and migration scripts.
- **llm-to-bedrock** — execute an AI/LLM migration: rewrite your SDK calls to Amazon Bedrock's Converse API, run quality evaluation against a golden dataset, and deliver the changes on a ready-to-merge git branch. (On platforms without subagent dispatch it runs inline — slower, but fully functional.) The migration skills delegate the AI-execution step here.
- **agent-advisor** — decide how and where to run AI agents on AWS: deterministic runtime scoring (AgentCore / ECS / EKS / Lambda / Batch / MicroVMs), multi-workload decomposition into units, Temporal worker handling, and a layered recommendation → migration plan → deployable POC.

## Repository Structure

Each top-level folder is owned by a team and contains their plugins, tools, or resources:

```

## Adding a Plugin

To add a new plugin to the marketplace:

1. Create your plugin under your team's folder (e.g., `migrate/plugins/my-plugin/`)
1. Include a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest in your plugin directory
1. Add an entry to the root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": "./my-team-folder/plugins/my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What your plugin does"
}
```

1. Submit a PR — requires approval from `@awslabs/startups-admins` (for marketplace changes) and your team's CODEOWNERS (for plugin content)
